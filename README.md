This project was developed by the 27th Batch of the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at Constructor Academy, featuring a diverse and skilled team. Vladimir Kumov, originally from Russia and now working in Germany, serves as the Tech Lead with a specialization in frontend development and a notable role in the urban cycling advocacy project, Letâ€™s Bike It. Imane Boumeshouli, a Full-Stack Developer from Morocco also based in Germany, brings a unique blend of programming prowess and experience as an Energy Efficiency & HSE Engineer. Janani Venugopal, another team member from India now in Germany, excels as a Full-Stack Developer with a robust background in software testing. From Bosnia and Herzegovina, now in Switzerland, Toni Pinjuh contributes as a front-end developer with a history as a CNC mechanic. Lastly, Michael Softic, a Frontend Developer from Croatia now in Germany, incorporates his expertise as a Graphic Designer into the project.
Problem 
Over the past 10-20 years, bicycles have become a prominent topic. Cities, countries, and larger institutions like the European Union are striving to integrate bicycle trips into urban settings. Some cities are more successful at this than others, which are struggling. A major issue is the lack of data on the challenges faced by urban cyclists. Typically, only data on fatal and injury-related accidents are reported. In areas where safety is compromised, issues like bicycle thefts and non-injury accidents often go unnoticed, yet these are frequently the very problems that deter people from cycling daily.

Solution
This project aims to create a platform for gathering detailed information on cycling incidents that often go unnoticed by official statistics. Its primary goal is to provide researchers and urban planners with actionable data that can enhance urban cycling safety. The initiative seeks to document not only accidents involving cyclists but also locations prone to bicycle thefts, near-miss incidents, and areas where modest improvements could significantly increase safety and convenience for cyclists. Through this endeavor, the project aspires to contribute to the broader mission of making cities more accommodating and safer for cyclists, thereby promoting a healthier, more sustainable mode of urban transport.

Contribution and Reporting: Users can contribute by reporting a variety of situations, not limited to incidents but also including suggestions for infrastructure improvements and legal adjustments. For each submission, users can provide:
Geolocation Tagging: Mark the exact location for the report, enabling precise identification and mapping.
Date and Time Specification: Record when the event occurred or when the observation was made to provide temporal context.
Detailed Categorization: Classify the report using predefined categories, such as accidents, near misses, theft, and suggestions for legalizing certain actions to improve cycling safety and convenience.
Photo Uploads: Allow for the attachment of photographs to visually document the situation, enhancing the report's clarity and usefulness.
Description: Offer an option for additional narrative, enabling contributors to describe the situation in detail.
Database Integration: A robust backend infrastructure to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve all user contributions. This system is key to maintaining a responsive and reliable platform.
Interactive Map: A dynamic frontend feature that visualizes the reports on an interactive map. This visualization not only categorizes the contributions by type (e.g., accidents, thefts, infrastructure suggestions) but also provides an intuitive and accessible way for users to explore the data.
User Interaction on Reports: Ability to comment on reports by others, fostering a community-driven discussion on cycling safety and infrastructure improvements.
Mobile Responsive Design: Ensuring the website is easily accessible on various devices, enhancing user engagement. 
Analytics Dashboard: For users, administrators, and partner organizations to view statistics and trends related to cycling incidents and infrastructure issues.
Research and Data Export Tools: Our platform includes tools designed for city administrations, public organizations, and academic researchers to analyze and export data. Users can download individual reports in PDF format or export all data in GeoJSON format, facilitating further study and policy formulation.

Technology stack
This website was designed with React and JavaScript for a dynamic frontend, combined with Django and Python in the backend for robust data processing. User interactions are managed securely with JWT, while PostgreSQL and ponyORM handle database operations efficiently. The site is designed with Styled Components, with interactive features powered by Charts.js and Mapbox. Everything is hosted on DigitalOcean for reliable performance, and GitLab is used for efficient version control management. This technology stack ensures that the website is not only interactive and visually appealing, but also secure and easy to manage.
